# **WordleLiteCL**

## **Overview**

**WorldeLiteCL** is a lightweight, heavily simplified clone of the very popular Worlde game It is a command-line implementation of the popular Wordle game with no real UI. The goal remains the same as the classic which is to guess a 5-letter word within 6 attempts, with hints provided after each guess:

* 游릴 **Green**: Correct letter in the correct position.  
* 游릳 **Yellow**: Correct letter but in the wrong position.  
* 游린 **Red**: Incorrect letter.

The word selection is weighted using word frequency data to ensure that the random words chosen are words that are recognizable to the user and not just words that are technically a word but, nobody uses.
